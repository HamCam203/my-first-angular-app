# FaceSnap üì∏üíö - Angular Project

## üìù Description
FaceSnap is an Angular application that allows users to discover, like, and explore a gallery of photos called "FaceSnaps". Each FaceSnap can be liked, and the application displays the number of likes for each photo. The main goal of the project is to understand the interaction with dynamic data in an Angular environment.

## Features

- **Display of FaceSnaps**: Users can view different photos (FaceSnaps) along with titles and descriptions.
- **Interaction with photos**: Users can like a photo by clicking a button.
- **Highlighting liked Snaps**: When a Snap is liked, a special visual style is applied to highlight the interaction.
- **Responsiveness and animations**: The interface is responsive and includes animations to make the experience smoother.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- **Angular**: The main framework used for the application development.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language used for the project.
- **CSS/SCSS**: Custom styles for a visually appealing interface.
- **RxJS**: Used to manage data reactivity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node package manager)

  
## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
